## Overview of the Analysis
In this project, we analyzied the city bikes data in NYC to understand certain patterns and insights that would be helpful in starting our own bike business. The data provided us with details about the birth year of the riders, gender, start point, end porint, trip duration, trip start time, and trip end time.

## Results
Checkout Times for Users: This chart shows on average how long the bikers rode by bike for. More tha 95% of the users rented a bike for less than 1 hour with the majority riding it for 5 mins. We can conclude the bikers do not rent the bike for a long distance

Checkout Times by Gender: We can conlude that both men and women rent the bike in similar time periods. However, there is a lot more male than female renters

Trips by weekday for Hour: From this heatmap, we can see the peak hours were betwee 8am and 9am and 5pm and 7pm. There were not that many bikers from 11pm to 4am so this will be an ideal time to do bike repairs

Trips by Gender: The time period for both male and female were similar. But from the colors, we can tell that there were a lot more male than female bikers

User Trips by Gender by Weekday: From the charts, we can see that around 65% of the bikers were men. Also, there was more volumne on Thursday adn Friday compared to the other days. 

Bike Utilization: This chart shows which bikes had the most rides with the size of the bubble. For example we can see that bike 39570 had one of the most rides with 3838467 rides. 

Bike Repair: The heatmap shows which bikes needed the most repair. We can see that bike 38124 needed the most repairs with 479 trips.


## Summary
From the dashboards above, we can see that there is a high demand for bikes in NYC where tourism is high. Some other insights we can gain from the data is the age group. We can see which age group uses the most bikes and for how long. Another visualization can be the most popular location. From this data, we can install more bike rental stations near that area to increase revenue.
